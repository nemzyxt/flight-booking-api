# Flight Booking API

## Requirements

   NodeJS (npm) \
   MongoDB

## Set-Up

1. Clone this repository .
2. Navigate to the project directory .
3. Run "npm install" .
4. Run "node setup.js" \
(Ensure that MongoDB is running before performing step 4)

## Running

1. On the terminal, within the project directory, run "npm start" .

### This will start the API on port 8000

You can now start interacting with the API's various endpoints .

## NOTE

   Running the setup.js file simply adds sample flights data to the database

## Next Steps  

Next steps would involve test running the requests embedded in the \
tests directory (you can add the REST Client extension on VS code)
```
test.rest
```

Alternatively, you can use a 3rd-party tool like Postman
